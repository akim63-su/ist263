Economics -> I’m a Economics major interested in improving myself in order to roll money and understand the concept of world money flow which could provide myself to blend in in terms of learning money and how to spend & save it. 

My hobbies are reading books and playing video games. I love to enjoy myself both in online world and off-line world. I enjoy watching loads of movies at once during the holidays and also enjoying myself in the gym and meeting friends. 
I do have healthy family relationships which made my life a lot more easier by removing one of the biggest relationship problems in my life. 
Once I was a athlete in South Korea for 5 years until I got into multiple car accidents. After the accident, I decided myself to get into a world of Economics to improve my life’s wealth and to be stabilized from this competitive world.
